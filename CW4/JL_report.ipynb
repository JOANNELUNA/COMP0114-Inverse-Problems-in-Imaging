    "(1) Firstly, I load and display the Shepp-Logan phantom image of size 128 ×128 with a numpy file called 'SLphan.npy', which is a commonly used test image in medical imaging. The Shepp-Logan phantom is a 2D image that simulates the attenuation properties of various tissue types in a human head, and is often used to test and evaluate image reconstruction algorithms. I refer this 128 ×128 image as $f_{true}$.\n",

In this case, since the Shepp-Logan phantom has a size of $(128, 128)$, the length of the diagonal is $\\sqrt{128^2 + 128^2} \\approx 181$, so the sinogram has a size of $(180, 181)$. \n",

    "(5) To check how the error in the reconstruction grows with the scale of the measurement noise, I compute the MSE value against the background intensity.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The MSE value is plotted against the background intensity, which is inversely proportional to the noise level, as shown above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The error in reconstruction generally increases as the measurement noise level increases. This is because the noise adds a random component to the measurements, which in turn affects the reconstructed image. The higher the noise level, the more significant the impact on the reconstructed image. Therefore, in general, it is desirable to minimize the measurement noise level to obtain more accurate reconstructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that this relationship between background intensity and the error in reconstruction is not linear. The rate of decrease slows down as the background intensity increases. For example, the decrease in error is more significant for background intensity values between 1 and 10 compared to values between 10 and 20, and similarly for values between 10 and 20 compared to values between 20 and 30, and so on."

    "### 2. Calculate an explicit matrix form of the Radon transform and investigate its SVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The singular value decomposition (SVD) of the explicit matrix form of the Radon transform provides insights into image's properties and structure. In the case of the Radon transform. When varying the range of angles and number of projections, the amount of information available to reconstruct the image is essentially changed. The number of projections determines the amount of information about the object's geometry, while the range of angles determines the coverage of projections. As the number of projections or the range of angles is increased, more information about the object's structure is captured, resulting in a larger number of singular values in the SVD spectrum. \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Firstly, compute and plot the singular value spectrum for the Radon transform matrix of a given image size, for *different numbers of projection angles*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes in two arguments: *image_size*, which is an integer specifying the size of the square image to use, and *num_angles_list*, which is a list of integers specifying the number of projection angles to use for each computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It first creates a zero matrix $A$ of appropriate size, and loops over each pixel in the image. For each pixel, it creates a new image with a single pixel of value $1$ at that position, takes the Radon transform of that image, and reshapes the result into a column vector. The column vector is then added to the matrix $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all the columns have been added to $A$, the function computes the singular value decomposition of $A$ using NumPy's `linalg.svd` function. It then plots the singular values of the matrix against their index, both for each individual computation and for all the computations together.\n",

    "The graph above shows the distribution of singular values of the Radon transform matrix for different numbers of projections (i.e. angles) in the range 0 to 180 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As the number of projections increases, the index range of singular values also increases. This is because increasing the number of projections means more information is available about the image, resulting in a more complete representation of the image in the Radon transform domain. This leads to a larger number of non-zero singular values, which increases the index range of the singular values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The maximum value of singular value increases as the number of projections increases because increasing the number of projections means more information is available about the image, resulting in a more complete representation of the image in the Radon transform domain. This leads to a larger maximum singular value, which indicates that there is a stronger signal in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The shape of the distribution of singular values among its index is similar as the number of projections increases because increasing the number of projections means more information is available about the image, resulting in a more complete representation of the image in the Radon transform domain. This leads to a more uniform distribution of singular values, which indicates that there is less noise in the data. As a result, the shape of the singular value distribution becomes more uniform and less sensitive to small changes in the number of projections, as long as the number of projections is sufficiently large. This is because the additional information provided by the extra projections helps to fill in gaps in the singular value distribution and reduce the effects of noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, the value of the singular value decreases along its index because the singular values represent the contribution of each singular vector to the image. The first few singular vectors represent the most significant contributions to the image, while the later singular vectors represent less significant contributions. As the number of projections increases, the first few singular vectors become more significant and contribute more to the image, while the later singular vectors become less significant and contribute less to the image. This leads to a decrease in the value of the singular values along its index.\n"

    "(2) Secondly, compute and plot the singular value spectrum for the Radon transform matrix of a given image size, for *different range of projection angles*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method is similar to the previous function, but instead of changing the number of projections for the sinogram, this function changes the range of projection angles while keeping the number of projections fixed at $45$. The maximum angle range is varied by changing the *max_angles* parameter, and the resulting SVD spectrum is plotted against the maximum angle range.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The index range of singular values , as well as the maximum value of singular value, remain the same as the range of angles increases because the number of projection samples remains constant. The matrix $A$ is constructed with a fixed number of projection samples, which determines the number of rows in the matrix and the maximum index range of the singular values. The range of angles determines the number of columns in the matrix and the number of non-zero singular values, but it does not affect the index range of the singular values as well as the maximum singular value..\n",
    "\n",
    "* The distribution of singular values does not change proportionally as the range of angles increases because the limited-angle projection data contains less information about the image than the full-angle projection data. As a result, the limited-angle projection data may lead to a more incomplete and uneven representation of the image in the Radon transform domain, which can affect the shape and distribution of the singular values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the limited-angle projection data may lead to missing or distorted features in the image, which can result in gaps or peaks in the singular value distribution at certain indices. These gaps or peaks may be more prominent at intermediate indices, where the contribution of the missing or distorted features is most significant. The effect of limited-angle projection data on the singular value distribution can depend on the specific image and projection geometry, and may require careful regularization or reconstruction techniques to mitigate."
