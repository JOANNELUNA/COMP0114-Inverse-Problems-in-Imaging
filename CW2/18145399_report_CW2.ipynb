    "#### The choice of the value of alpha\n",
    "When the value of the regularization parameter alpha was set to 0.01, the deblurred image produced by Method c was unclear. However, when alpha was set to 1, the deblurred image became much clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that alpha=0.01 was too small, and the regularization term had little effect in suppressing the noise in the observed image. As a result, the noise dominated the solution, leading to an unclear deblurred image. On the other hand, alpha=1 may have been a better choice, as it struck a good balance between noise suppression and image fidelity, resulting in a clearer deblurred image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The choice of Deconvolution method \n",
    "Method c is faster and requires fewer iterations to converge than Method d.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method c uses the normal equations, which can be solved using a Krylov solver such as PCG or GMRES. The normal equations can be derived from the optimality conditions for the Tikhonov regularization problem, and their solution provides the optimal solution to the deblurring problem. Since the normal equations involve a symmetric positive definite matrix, a Krylov solver can efficiently solve the linear system without requiring an explicit matrix representation of the convolution operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Method d uses an augmented equation approach, which involves solving a linear least squares problem using a solver such as lsqr. This method may require more iterations to converge because the least squares problem may not have a closed-form solution and the iterative solver may need to compute many iterations to approximate the solution. In addition, the implementation of the augmented equation method requires more memory to store the augmented system matrix."
